Used without permission, but I hope they won't mind.

Ingrediants:
- 4 slices white bread
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 2 slices Cheddar cheese

Preheat skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side-
down onto skillet bottom and add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place 
butter-side-up on top of sandwich. Grill until lightly browned and flip over; continue grilling until cheese 
is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter and slice of cheese.
